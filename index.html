        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>
          Hello, I’m Carlos. Cuban-American, raised in Florida, living in
          Oregon. With aspirations of moving to Japan. In my past lives, I was a
          bartender, auto painter, martial artist, and Viking. The only
          consistent aspect of my life has been my love for art and design.
          After escaping a cult, I became fascinated with how people think and
          behave. I believe thoughtful design can improve our lives in
          unexpected and meaningful ways. Im always stoked when I open a door
          properly on the first try. I took a lot of detours getting into the
          design field. But all those experiences shaped my perspective of the
          world in ways I dont believe are common in the industry…although im
          sure many people would say the same thing. But this is my website!
